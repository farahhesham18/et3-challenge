 In the first folder called task one , it is a code made by python which extract the images to from folders and subfolders
 in the file named :dairies which have no specific depth and put them in a a new file here named : images_dataset.

 And then remove the prefix from the images , example : Milk-Oated-medium_001.jpg should be 001.jpg.
 
 Then save these images name without the prefix , the image size , and the image last modification date in a csv file
 called: report.csv.

 To run the code you have to take the code and then change the file according to your images files.

 And change the paths according to your files, and then it will save the report.csv automatically.

 and the files attached is an example on a dataset with extraction and everything.

 In the second folder called task two, it is a code made by python to transfer a file .txt to a file .json.

 This file.txt is containing a details of an image which is the output of a detection system named : image1.txt.

 This .txt have a specific format you should see it attached above , and the .json also have a specific format 
 also so it should be transfered to it you should see it attached above.

 to run the code you should attach your own .txt file to be an input and then the .json file should be created with this format.

 the created .json format named image1.json named after the .txt , and I attached it to see the format how it should be.

 Files attached is only an example.
